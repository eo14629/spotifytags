# Spotify Tagging Software
Playlists are rubbish - Venn diagrams are better.

Our music is getting lost in Spotify due to our inability to organise and categorise in an efficient manner by simply using playlists. Tagging is a tool which should be able to help fix this issue

# Description

Simple Java application to be able to make playlists through the Spotify API via tagging songs with various labels. This way, playlists can be created on the fly depending on which tags you want to listen to.

# Current Goals
Set up database to store the tags.
Basic class structure to encompass songs and tags

# Future Developments
Python Spotify API will be used:
- Tag all songs in library
- Create real playlist by selecting a combination of tags
- Each time a new song is added to a tag, this adds it to the playlist.
